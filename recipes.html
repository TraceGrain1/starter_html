            <p>If you frequently suffer from dessert decision paralysis, then this apple crisp cheesecake will be the answer to your prayers. This fall dessert combines two classic favorites—apple crisp and creamy cheesecake—into one treat that’s just as impressive to present as it is to eat. A buttery graham cracker crust is topped with our creamy caramel and cinnamon cheesecake before adding the pièce de résistance: the apple crisp-inspired topping.</p>

            <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 325° and grease an 8" or 9" springform pan with cooking spray.</li>
                <li>Make crust: In a large bowl, mix together graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, cinnamon, sugar, and salt. Press into bottom of prepared pan and up the sides.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl using a hand mixer (or in the bowl of a stand mixer), beat cream cheese, caramel, and sugar together until completely smooth.

        <p>Sweet potato pie might be the Cinderella of Thanksgiving desserts—under-appreciated and overlooked—but with this forever favorite recipe, we’re bringing her into the spotlight and making her shine. Mounds of roasted sweet potato combine with dark brown sugar, vanilla, and spices inside a golden flaky crust for a pie that rivals all other contenders.</p>
        <h3>Recipie Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 lb. sweet potatoes (about 3 medium)</li>
            <li>All-purpose flour, for rolling</li>
            <li>1 batch basic pie dough, chilled</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>3/4 c. heavy cream</li>
            <li>2/3 c. (135 g.) dark brown sugar</li>
            <li>4 tbsp. (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>2 tsp. pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 tsp. ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. kosher salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425° and line a baking sheet with foil. Pierce potatoes on all sides with a fork and arrange on prepared sheet. Roast until completely tender, 45 to 50 minutes. Let sit until cool enough to handle.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, on a lightly floured surface, roll pie dough to a 1/4"-thick round. Lift and carefully transfer to a glass or metal 9" pie pan. Lift up edges and allow dough to slump down into dish (do not stretch).</li>
            <li>Using a sharp knife or kitchen shears, trim edges of dough, leaving about a 1/4" overhang. Fold excess dough underneath dough on top rim of pie pan. Using clean fingers, crimp to seal. Refrigerate until cold, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place a rack in center of oven; preheat to 375°. Cut a large square piece of foil or parchment and scrunch to wrinkle. Line dough with scrunched foil, then fill to the brim with pie weights, uncooked rice, or dried beans.</li>
            <li>Bake crust until top and sides are dry and set, 18-20 minutes. Remove foil with pie weights. Continue to bake until bottom is dry and set, about 5 minutes more. Let cool. Reduce oven temperature to 350°.</li>
            <li>Peel potatoes and trim off any overly caramelized patches. Measure 2 cups (about 450 grams) potato and transfer to a food processor. Pulse, scraping down sides as needed, until well blended. Add eggs, cream, brown sugar, butter, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Continue to pulse, scraping down sides every 30 seconds, until smooth, about 90 seconds total.</li>
            <li>Pour filling into crust. Bake pie until filling is puffed and set around the outside and just slightly jiggly in the middle, 40 to 50 minutes. Let cool before slicing and serving.</li>

            By now, the pumpkin spice craze has gone way beyond the classic pumpkin spice latte (and honestly, we’re not mad about it). These pumpkin spice cupcakes are one of our go-to fall desserts once the season begins: they’re full of pumpkin spice, sweet pumpkin flavor, and topped with a simple cream cheese frosting. Whether you go crazy for pumpkin spice or all things pumpkin, these cupcakes should be at the top of your baking list this fall.</p>
        <h3>Recipie Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>

        </ul>

        <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350° and line two muffin tins with liners. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, pumpkin pie spice, salt, baking powder, and baking soda.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl using a hand mixer (or in the bowl of a stand mixer), beat butter and sugars together until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add vanilla and pumpkin puree and beat until incorporated. Add dry ingredients and mix until just combined.</li>
            <li>Fill cupcake liners ¾ full and bake until a toothpick inserted in middle of a cupcake comes out clean, 23 minutes. Let cool completely.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make frosting: In a large bowl using a hand mixer (or in the bowl of a stand mixer), beat cream cheese and butter until smooth. Add powdered sugar and pumpkin pie spice and beat until no lumps remain, then add vanilla and a pinch of salt.</li>
            <li>Transfer to a piping bag fitted with a large round tip and swirl frosting onto cooled cupcakes.</li>
