            <h3>Geographical Location: North America</h3>
            <p>Port Huron, Michigan one of the few places in michigan where you have to drive south to get to Canada, the childhood home of Thomas Edison, and most importantly where I am from!</p>
            <p>Port Huron is a small midwestern town of about 30,000 people. It's a place where everyone knows your name and who you've dated. A place where small town America values ring true. A place that no one really ever leaves and if you do you usually come back. It's very likely what you enjoy for fun is a mixture of golf, hunting for sport and boating on the beautiful Lake Huron.</p>

            <h3>Geographical Location: North America</h3>
            <p>Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, a once well kept secret in the Northeast. The place a retirement and now resting of my great grandmother and both of my grandparents. Martha's Vineyard is the place of congregation of my extended family as my grandparents vacationed there during my fathers youth. My grandmother was a public activist and sevant on the island fighting for better lives of the inhabitants of the island throughout the 1970s, 80s and 90s while my grandfather was a well respected and highly desired picture framer after a career delivering mail in the city of New York</p>
            <p>Martha's Vineyard is now known as a place where America's elite have multi-million dollar homes and go to vacation during the summer time, but to me Martha's vineyard is so much more than that. It is place for family and a place for gathering with loved ones</p>

            <h3>Geographical Location: North America</h3>
            <p>Washington, D.C., the home of the American Commander and Chief. One of the oldest cities in the United States (which you can tell by the cities architecture). Many think it is an overly politicized city, but that couldn't be further from the truth. Hailed as "Chocolate City" a place of soul and color, the birth place of gogo music. One of the few major black cities in America. Washington, D.C. was the place where my first job out of school and holds a special place in my heart</p>
            <p>Washington D.C., has an  incredible food and music scene! I would often spend my weekends, when I wasn't working, finding new restaurants in the city. A personal favorite was Hanks Oyster Bar which was right in my neighborhood. I looked forward to going there on sunday mornings for an oyster breakfast, typically with one of my best friends</p>
